# rest-api-with-node

This is a POC done to understand how to implement REST APIs using NodeJS.

The code uses these libraries:
- body-parser: which is used for converting incoming request to javascript objects
- cors: to allow the apis to accept requests coming from different origin.
- helmet: to secure Express APIs.
- morgan: to implement logging capabilities to the Express API.

A detailed tutorial can be found in the below link which has been provided as a reference.

Authentication is not implemented as of now and is something which might be taken up at later point of time.
